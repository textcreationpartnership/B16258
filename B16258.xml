            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

His profession was a fisherman of <hi>Feuersham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> though his pride at last would be confinde to no limits, nor any thing would serue him but the wide Ocean to walke in. In this wicked resolution, he set foorth from <hi>Feuersham</hi> in a small Catch towards <hi>Plimouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He stayed not long there, but he betooke himselfe to the Streights, where lying off and on the Southward Cape, called Saint <hi>Vincent,</hi> he tooke a small Pincke of some foure score Tunne: with here making a continuance of his course, and setting forward his wicked purposes, to the tryall of their fortunes, he tooke also another smal vessell called a Setty: and her he brought out of the Streights into <hi>Argier</hi> euen at that time when as the Turkes Gallies should haue

            <p>But <hi>Ward</hi> hauing gotten much mony at Sea, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inricht himselfe with vnlawfull purchase by his Setty, ioynes wth certaine <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THis <hi>VVard</hi> had a vaile for euery vanity: and the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of his wicked practises, had cleane taken away the feeling of his wickednes. All his felicity was placed in the prosecuting of mischiefe, he neither mistrusteth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent death, nor feareth daungerous endurance, or menaces of torments, so the Barke of his hope may but ride at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, that is wasted instreames of spoile and ruine: Euery pecrill vndertaken in his vnnatural actions, seemes pleasant to him, euery reproach honorable, euery doubt delightsome, yea the very wounds that come by occasions of others harmes, seeme void of smart vnto him. His life is nothing but a continuall battaile and defiance with Christians, with whome he ought to make his best peace, His sences are as so many swords that fight against him, his wordes so many blowes, his deedes so many wounds.</p>
            <p>He stayed not long in <hi>Argier</hi> but his heart was on fire, till he had made proofe of the fortunes of his Setty, for he had now left the Catch he came foorth in, and made the Setty (which he tooke) his man of Warre: with her he went from <hi>Argier</hi> towards the bottome of the Streights, or about <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:173113:3"/> Warre of <hi>Malta</hi> set forth on purpose to take him, he began, to bestirre himselfe, for his desires admitted no limitation, nor could he perswade his minde to submit his necke to any seruile yoake. The law of nature (quoth he) allowes euery man to defend himselfe being assailed and to withstand force by force, and in that resolution opposeth himselfe against the force of his enemy. Many assaults were made, and seuerall showers of shot sent foorth on both sides, yet the forces of <hi>VVard</hi> did so farre disanimate the <hi>Maltan,</hi> as the edge of his courage was cleane taken away and forct to submit himselfe to the mercy of his enemy <hi>Ward</hi> that in all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions aimd at nothing more then to strengthen himselfe with men munition and money, to gaine successe to his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, hauing gotten the vpper hand in this encounter, made purchace of what he found, and left it to the choice of such as were taken in her, either to be resolued to subiect thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to his seruice, or submit their neckes to the stroke of death. Of the two they rather chose the first, as hoping after a long time of enforced seruitude, to obteine an vnexpected freedome and teleasement. <hi>Ward</hi> by this purchase (the ship of <hi>Malta</hi> being well mand) did ad much power to his former strength, and therefore sayling from thence he bended his course to <hi>Tunis,</hi> where he intended to victuall his ship, and to prouide himselfe to the like wicked imployments.</p>

            <p>AFter the flight of these <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the sale of their goods aforesaid, and that <hi>Ward</hi> in his consultations had aduisd him selfe what his next course should be, it was thought best that he should goe forth in course and at randon, and make pray and spoile of whom soeuer they met.

In this resolue lying off &amp; on, (as he did then) about the gulfe of <hi>Venice,</hi> an accident befell worthy note, for example, and may be a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the like headstrōg and irregular enterprises. There hapned a great storme, and tempest, and the ship being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with ordnance, &amp; cutting away her timber to make more ports to place ordnance, he so weakned his ship, that meeting the same foule weather, the rage of winde and Sea was so great as his Argosey was filled with waues, her tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, sails, and Anchors lost and the violent storme so da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed her bulks and brused her bottom, as she was made altogether vnfit, and vnable for resistance, and so was sunke, and cast away. His maister was one Master <hi>Grafton:</hi> in her there were some foure score English men and three hundred Turkes, all drownd and that last their liues. Some foure dayes before this tempest this <hi>Ward</hi> with his lieftenant one <hi>William Graues</hi> a trūpeter forsooke the great Argosey by reason that the Turks being so manie in number, tooke vpon them to beare too great a sway, and grew too peremptory and insolent, which the haughtines of <hi>Wards</hi> minde could not any way brooke or disgest, and went vnto the vice Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall▪ and so saued his life and scapt that danger.</p>
            <p>This losse was so great, that it was accounted the first of aduerse fortunes that hapned vnto him in al his proceedings and it was obserued by some in his company that were a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tl better minded then the rest, and adiudged an efficient that

            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Ward</hi> soone changd their mindes from these good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for he that was so obdurate from all goodnes himselfe, could not indure to perceiue any relenting spirits in others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Graues,</hi> (his liefetennant) was very inward with him, and one that among the rest might do most with him, yet in their contentions, and falling out at their feastings &amp; <hi>Bachanals,</hi> would often reuile <hi>Ward,</hi> calling him Boore, and Oyster-catcher, and vpbraid him with the meane basenes of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and would often tel him that if it should one day be his fortune to kill him (as he thought it would) he doubted not but God would presently send an Angell from heauen to carry him immediately thither for depriuing the earth of such a villanous creature.</p>

What though he be able yet to boast of freedome, when eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry threed about him is a manifest marke of his captiuity like to happen? and when his sence, body and minde, is seruile to his owne sensuality?

For <hi>Fisher</hi> being imployed in a Marchants ship, <hi>VVard</hi> hales him to him in the Streights, and at his comming, questions with him about his wife, and whether he had deliuered the hundreth pounds he sent by him: <hi>Fisher</hi> affirmd that he had, but he knowing the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry &amp; charging him w<seg rend="sup">c</seg> it <hi>Fisher</hi> could not greatly deny it, <hi>ward</hi> thought to pay himself for his losse before they parted, &amp; made

            <p>This strooke <hi>Fisher</hi> into a deepe quandary, yet he knew not how to mend himselfe: but after the shippes were cleere, he began to reuile and raile against <hi>Ward</hi> and to giue him bad and discontented speeches, which stood not with <hi>Wards</hi> minde and resolution to brooke, or put vp, so as he presently fitted him selfe and boorded him againe: this incounter was worsse then the first, for it was deadly.

            <p>The last of which most sternely looking vp, as strernely tolde vs, that if we would not presently strike our Topsaile, thereby to shew our yéelding was immediate, they would lay vs directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board with their ships, and as readilie sincke vs.</p>
            <p>When we as resolute to repell, as our enemies were ready to offer, boldly answered them, that if they were as constant as their speech, to lay vs aboard, wee willed them to come on, for we were fitted to bid them welcome. But such a hote entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should they finde, as all the water that bare them, shoulde hardly bring them into a coole temper againe, being then indéed purposely minded (finding little comfort by resistance, and no assurance to escape,) to burne our selues and them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>When they vnderstanding our entent, by the boldnesse of our answere, compassed vs about on euery side, with prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to fight, and at length to sinke vs with their ordinance, béeing so well enabled for such a dead purpose, as Turkish Pirats (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this our calamity) haue beene neuer heard to be so strongly furnished.</p>
            <p>But to our purpose, we seeing them so ready for the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, neglected nothing of the strength wee had to fortifie vs for our defence, some of vs managing all things fitly beneath, whilst that others mande all thinges readily aboue: euery man of vs hauing made his soule fit for heauen, &amp; commēding his body to a watry graue. So that wee beseech you now to conceiue, that wee had fitted our netting, hung out our drablers, and that you see vs ready for a Sea sight, we hauing little but faithfulnesse and courage to withstand them, and they like a violent Sea rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to beate against an vnfortified shore, where the weakest must of force be ouerthrowne.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:173113:10"/>
            <p> So that as they were ready to call vpon vs in fire, and we as furnished to make answere in flame, there were diuers <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> among them (whom they had taken before) imprisoned in chaines like slaues, and condemned to perpetuall slauerie, in pitty of vs belike, finding it vnprofitable (it should séeme) to complaine for themselues, with teares in their eyes, which shewed they had sorrow in their hearts, who cryed and called alcude vnto vs (and specially to our Master, M. <hi>Banister,</hi> by name) that as we were men, as we tendred our owne safeties: If wee had a desire to sée our Countrey againe: if wee had parents to mourne for their sonnes, wiues to lament for their husbands or children to cry out for their fathers, not to shoot so much as the voice of one smal shot against them: for if we did, such as was their sentence such should bee our ends, continuall thraldom. For this was a decrée amongst them (which they had established should stand irreuocable) that what Christian soeuer they met, (be he of what Country soeuer) if he submitted not vpon the first sommons, or durst bee so hardy, as to out-dare them with the least blast of breath: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But we admonish you as brothers &amp; desire you to remember.</p>
            <q>Foelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.</q>
            <p>We haue withstood them as you may do, which hath brought vs into slauerie, as you shall bee: Oh be aduised then, before you fall, and seeke to saue your selues before you perish.</p>
            <p>But if you thinke it not necessarie to bee aduised by our admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition▪ or your resolution be such, to preferre an honourable death before a dishonorable peace then fight it out brauely, while you haue any refuge of life▪ or that your ship hath any safetie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to swimme, since that death is the easiest taske, the which you now haue in hand.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:173113:11"/>
            <p> With which words of theirs, euen the Infidels themselues being mooued to compassion, by which you may iudge (séeing no other safetie but destruction) that wee had reason to bee driuen into consideration of our states, so that after a second sommons we had parley with those our desperate enemies, for the space of an houre, the end and purpose was, Whether we would yéeld for our liberties, or giue our bodies to the Sea: when we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how vnequally wee were matched, beeing incompassed round about and assaulted with thrée ships, the Admirall carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 30. pieces of Ordinance, and the other two wherewith they were consorted, hauing 28. a piece: beside sixe hundreth Turkes with small shot, who are held the best shot in the world, we being but 20. men, and our ship bearing but a 11. pieces of Ordinance, wee strucke our sailes and yéelded, holding it more discretion to stand to their mercie for our liberties, whom we had no abilitie to confound, then desperatly and willfully to destroy our selues, and the estate we had of yours.</p>
            <p>Thus after our yéelding, Sir, they presently boarded vs, and commanded that our Maister, and eleuen of our Company were carryed aboard their Admirall, where after consultation had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, &amp; we seuerally dispersed into their ships, and diuers appointed to goe aboard of ours, it being almost darke, when we were taken, we were for that night guarded, and euery man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his Centinell to watch him.</p>
            <p>The next Morning the Captaines of the men of Warre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted, how to dispose of vs and our shippes, where, in this misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune it fortunately fell out, that our Master hauing in former Voyages, much vsed the Trade of transporting of Passengers, from <hi>Argier,</hi> and <hi>Tunis,</hi> to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> he séemed well to be remembred by many of these Pirates (who more then we expected lamenting our case) informed their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, what seruice heretofore our Master had done to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as also what courtesie both themselues, and diuers of their friends had receiued at his hands, that our ship was not a stranger vnto them, for our Master had brought in her the last Voyage, be great Bashaw of <hi>Tunis,</hi> from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Tunis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which fortunate accident, was one and the chiefe cause, that you shall sée your Vessell againe, or, we our Countrey and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies:
<pb facs="tcp:173113:11"/> and another, that our ship was laden with corne, which they vtterly neglected, as a commoditie vnworthy of them. In briefe, the ende of their consultation was, that our shippe should be restored: which vnderstood by the souldiers (I beseech you, let it not grieue you to read, what with terror wée did behold) how they presently came aboard vs, fell violently to ransake: pili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our Trafficke, cutting downe our Cabbens, and stauing our chests to pieces, leauing vs nothing to call our owne, but what we had on our backes, they tooke away all the powder we had, sauing what our Ordinance was laden withall, leauing vs not so much beside, as would preyne one Peece. They bereft vs of most of our great shot, all our muskets, all our small shot, our match, pikes, ladles, spunges, rapiers, swords, daggers of all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary munition for defence whatsoeuer: leauing nothing with vs (what necessitie so euer should sueccéed) but the vast sea, and the vnconstant windes to defend vs.</p>
            <p>Neither séemed this crueltie to them sufficient, but as they were about to leaue vs, hauing as it were bethought them of some new encounter, they violently came backe, at whose returne (building no great confidence in the promises of Turkes and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats) we expected either slaughter or slauery: But contrary to our expectation (although badde) better was their purpose namely to teare from vs part of our Sailes and Tacklings, to take from vs our Béefe, Cables, all our Butter, and Chéese, Rise, and Oyle, so that although they gaue vs liberty they would not leaue vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out languishment, although they could find in their harts to bid vs farewell, yet they would doe the best in them consisted, to famish vs ere we could come home. Inbriefe, we were left nothing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend vs, little or nothing to féed vs, miserie enough to torment vs, so that to your charitable considerations, we submit our lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cause by your selues, but to be adiudged in what distresse they left vs.</p>
            <p>But ere I shall procéede to driue you into wonder; by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating all our succéeding accidents: I beseech you let mee with your patience to deliuer at full what hath happened in this.</p>
            <p>First, you cannot forget (I am certaine) that I related vnto you, that vpon our first yeelding, diuers of vs were conueyed a
<pb facs="tcp:173113:12"/> boorde of their shippes, and many of them (as well Turkes as English) shifted vnto ours, euery man of vs hauing for the first night his sentinell apointed to guarde him: where hauing little mind to sleepe, who were in doubt euery minute to haue our threats cut. Our purpose is to deliuer what with waking eyes we were witnesses of in this nights imprisonment. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish men being the first that boorded vs, they demmaund of vs with what was her lading, to whom wee answered, the the whole for the Marchant was Corne, besides wee had euery one some litle particuler venture for our selues or our friends: The which being matters of no valew, we desired &amp; hoped they would not make prey of, to which they answered, it was no way their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, neither was it their Captaine Captaine <hi>Wards</hi> pleasure, that any priuat Sea faring mans venture should be any way hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by him or his confederates. Wherefore quoth they, lest these Turkes, whom I toubt not but you haue heard to bee cruell e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and as the affaires with you now stand, haue as much commaund or more then our selues: if you haue any thing that you would defend from their gripe, deliuer it in trust to vs, and as we are your Countrimen, while wee continue together, wee will sée it faithfully reserued, and vpon your free discharge, restored to you at full: With this pit-fall poore birds were we caught: so that partly with feare not to dare to distrust them, and partly with hope to reserue somewhat, who were certaine we had lost all, euery man distributed vnto them what he had, namely of our needefull shifte of apparell, to wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te linnen and woollen, and our Master M. <hi>Banister,</hi> who was to goe aboord of them, euen his whole prouision, to the siluer whistle and Chaine about his neck, so that all that euery man had, he might say it was on his backe: Still hoping that theeues might prooue to be men of their words, and that there might bee found some conscience in them, because they were our countrimen. In short this was the successe of it, when we found our selues to be discharged, euery man began to enquire for him, to whom he had deliuered, but <hi>non est Inuentus,</hi> they were stolne away in the night, and our owne Countreymen had made vs their Cosens. So y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> being thus cheated of al our shift whatsoeuer, the occurrence of which at Sea, I know you neede not be remembred off, we began to complaine vs of our wrong,
<pb facs="tcp:173113:12"/> to the Turkes, and implored their assistance, who straight made vs this answer, since our owne nation had serued vs so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianly, what conscience were it in them to be courteous vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs? at which cold comfort Sir, euery man began to shrincke already, since that for want of shift hee knew he should bee low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie before he got home, but <hi>Necessitas non habet legem,</hi> and when there is no remedy to be had, it is but bootles to make resistance.</p>
            <p>By this time our master and his company (I beséech you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand) are discharged and sent backe againe, and our Consorts men put into vs, so that when they saw they could take no more, they heaued vp their hands and bad vs be gone, onely in our sight directing our Consorts ship the pearle for <hi>Tunes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any man shall further aske of you what entertainment our owne Countrimen gaue vs, since you had before to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that the Master, <hi>Maisters</hi> mate, Bosons, nay all their Sea faring men were Englishmen, truely I must report to you they vsed vs well, I and so well that the deuill in the habit of a Turke, would not haue vsed vs worse, for hauing had that which they expected, they could by no meanes affoord vs good wordes, and with much a doe allow vs bread and water. Now if this were not curtesie from our owne Countrimen, I hope there is no man will expect further euidence.</p>
            <p>But by the way, I beséech you to vnderstand, that when we had proued it for certaine, that <hi>Nullus ad amissas ibit, &amp;c.</hi> When wee saw there was no remedy, but for safety wee must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, euery one of vs, so farre as the occasion of time would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, endeauoured to make the best shift as he could for himselfe, which was to conuey in secret the particuler commodities &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures both of our owne and others of our especiall friendes at home, and which purpose of ours (before they had boorded vs) with much industry we had purchased, stowing some of them déep amongst the Corne, and ordering the rest, some in one place, some in another, where we thought it might be the most guarded from their search.</p>
            <p>But like the deuill, hauing broad eyes and quickesighted, they look far, and litle is done that can be concealed from them, and I hope you will not deny but these are of his neare acquaintance, so that bee wee as charie as ere we could (this gallimaufry of
<pb facs="tcp:173113:13"/> rogues I dare now call them so, béeing indéede more renegadoes than Turkes, for what conference wee had wee receiued from them in <hi>Italian)</hi> they did such remige in euery corner, that they were ouerlookers of all, and what they did find which they thought not vnworthy to bee contemned for the taking, they held it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courtesie to leaue it aboord, it was vnnecessary to bewaile vnto them, this is the Marchants, this is our owne, or this is our friends, for whatsoeuer they liked and laid hands on (being all sharers) they cryed one to another, this is for vs, <hi>vlira posse non est esse,</hi> their will is a law, they are frée men of the Sea, and their liberty must haue no resistance.</p>
            <p>In briefe, we beseech you to conceiue, that you sée vs parted, and wheras, it is continued as a commendable custome, for euery man to be sorry for his particular losses, it is now contrary with vs, for we were glad euen to our soules, when wee had lost them, and our eies had bid them heartily farewell, yet had we not the heart to shake hands together, we were not a litle glad when we loked back, and saw them as far a stearne as we could descry them but we were glad indéed, when we beheld for certaine that we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned them not at all, so that for that night we were out of Ken the one of the other.</p>
            <p>But the morning after by breake of the day (although to our colde comfort) we might espye they were come vp within a mile of vs againe, in which nearenesse wee might perceiue (as they formerly had had vs, so there was a Frenchman had now found they had him in chase, who first vsing the best wings hee had for his escape, but to a fruitlesse purpose, and after resisting them by an honourable fight, yet to as bootlesse an end, for that as wee were formerly forwarned, hee would not vaile his topsaile, and submit at their first shot: but trusting to their owne ablenes, stood out till they were surprised: our eies were made witnesses that they tooke the Merchant and the Master, &amp; hanged them vppe at their yard armes, and as before they had sent away one of ours so they commanded away his ship to <hi>Tunis,</hi> and made slaues of all the rest of the company, being fourescore and foure men in her: the pittifulnesse of which spectacle, wee being in the view of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding, would haue compelled any but such hated villaines, euen
<pb facs="tcp:173113:13"/> with teares for to haue lamented.</p>
            <p>Heere might you haue séene the poore captiues knéeling for pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, while the Conquerours triumphing ouer them, bound them backe to backe. Heere might you haue beheld the eies of the one full of sorrow, intreating for compassion, whilest the other euen in their faces did fléere at their calamitie, this we viewed (&amp; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>without much pitie) had happened vnto them: this we knew had we not yéelded, must haue befallen vnto vs. Théeuing is their liuing, blood is their exercise, tyranie is their practise: Christians are turned Turkes, and Turks are the sons of deuils, then what good can be expected from them? O what a lamentation is this, in one minute by the cruelty of villaines four-score and foure Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers shall be bereft of their sons, so many wiues be bereft of their husbands, and no doubt so many Children be dispoild of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: a calamitie so excéeding, that mee thinks, euen but at the report thereof, all Christendome should be made vp into one hand for the reuenge thereof.</p>
            <p>But well a day, this Tragedie is acted, death and slauery hath vsurped vpon these Innocents, well might we pitie them, but we knew we could no way preuaile to their helpe, so they nither ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to vs, nor wee desirous to haue more acquaintaince with them, away steard we for the shore, and ioyfull men we were you must think, hauing now nothing to loose but our liues, where we were cleere of them the second time.</p>
            <p>But who is desirous to shunne <hi>Scilla</hi> doth commonly fall vpon <hi>Caribdis,</hi> who carefully striues to auoid a dangerous rock doth often fall vpon more deuouring sands: one mischance doth seldome or neuer come, but there succéedes an other as his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritor, or according to our English prouerb, we striue out of Gods blessing into the warme sunne: euen so it fared with vs. for the very next day after we had discharged our selues of bad, we were subiect to fall into the iawes of worse, beeing now most eagerly pursued by a bloody Frenchman of warre, and a Pirate like the other, of whose cruelty we had heard of so much before, that wee accounted our selues compassed euen in the Armes and gripe of death, being but come within his sight, for where the other doth vse but to kill some, and make slaues of the rest, this vpholds it as a custome to make murther of all that ere he takes: this is not
<pb facs="tcp:173113:14"/> glutted with the hanging of one, two, or thrée, nay of twenty, but if he hapned to be at the taking of an hundred, he bindes them back to back, and burses them together.</p>
            <p>For two daies and a night this French Pirate had vs in chase and the winde beginning to grow duller and calme (although our shippe was of indifferent speede) hee was come within a mile of vs, so that the nearer we perceiued him, the néerer wee iudged our selues to our sudden destruction; it was in vaine to striue to make shift for our bodies: for wee had nothing to any purpose wherewith to make shift withall. Wherefore euery one hauing betaken himselfe to his prayers for the good of his soule, we were ready to offer our selues vp into the hands of him from whom it was in vaine to expect any mercy.</p>
            <p>So that being all armed with this determination, and voide of al feare, since we had no hope, whereon to anchor our trust, yet it pleased God who is the defence of his seruants, when we least thought of helpe, when all exepctation of rescue was frustrate, and when we had giuen our liues ouer to the ruine of their hands and our bodies to the seas, to send in sight of vs fiue ships vnder sayle, when wee (although we knew not what they were) chose rather to fall into the hands of ihem, whose pursuit made no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt against vs, than to submit our selues vnder the crueltie of him, who had so long held vs in chase, which to effect we made all the speed we could to get vp to them, and which intent of ours this Frenchman mistrusting, he on the contrary stroue as much as in him lay to cut vs off from our purpose: but spight of his practise, we being come within their ken, and that we gest they might discerne our inward myserie by our outward signes wee exprest the liuely motions of distressed men, as by knéeling on our knées, and holding vp our hands, which they perceiuing, although not knowing what we were, they in charity made vp to vs, and in short time wee were come within their command which this French-man considering, and gessing it would not prooue much for his ease, to make vp any néerer, he sprang aloofe, and left vs.</p>
            <p>These Ships prooued to be foure Englishmen, &amp; one Fleming, But by your patience, I must giue you to vnderstand, that vntill we had truly tasted their courtesie, we were as iealous of them,
<pb facs="tcp:173113:14"/> as of the rest, making a doubtfull question, whether it were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that trueth or honesty might he met at sea.</p>
            <p>Of these Ships English, one was Master <hi>Startop,</hi> another was Master <hi>Humfrey,</hi> the other two Ships, the one was of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and the other of <hi>Linne,</hi> at the méeting of whome, I pray you vnderstand, there was no litle ioy on both sides, in them that they had beene a meanes to rescue their Countrey-men; in vs, that they had preserued our liues, and what was left of yours.</p>
            <p>But nothing is there in this world, but is transitory like our selues, our life is not permanent, no more is our fortunes: wee haue ioy in this minute, and sorrow in the next: wee came crying into the world, and we must goe wéeping out, all which is verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vs, for as I began with sorrow, so farre as I can sée yet, I must make my period in sadnesse: for scarce had our ioy felt an houre of embracement, or our comfort giuen a hearty salutation the one to the other, when presently wee might perceiue our selues the third time to be had in chase by a man of warre, and his Pinnesse, who drawing néere vp to vs, wee perceiued it was Captaine <hi>Dansker</hi> of <hi>Argier,</hi> which ship of his is so potent in shew, that it seemed to vs any way resistlesse, for hee carried 55. péeces of Ordinance, besides 400. Turkes with small shot.</p>
            <p>Roome, comes hee amongest the thickest of our fléet, as if hee had had power to sweep vs away with his breath, but when hee came neere to vs, he caused his followers to waft vs amain with their glistering swords, threatning to sinke vs the one after the other, if at his command we did not immediatly strike, so that we thought we were now falling <hi>à malo ad peius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first Ship they came vp vnto was Master <hi>Startop,</hi> who seeing them so strongly furnished; so laden with Ordinance, and so powerfull in shot, he forth with yéelded himselfe vnto him.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Humfrey</hi> and the other two Ships of <hi>Yarmouth</hi> and <hi>Lin,</hi> by this hauing got the winde of <hi>Dansker,</hi> they steared backe againe to Master <hi>Startop,</hi> indending their vtmost endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to rescue him.</p>
            <p>And calling aloud to him, they bid him hoyse vp his sailes again, vowing to him by the faith they ought to their Country &amp; loue to their Countrymen, they would neuer forsake him, they would fight for him, reskue him, or die with him.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:173113:15"/>
            <p> But whether it were that M. <hi>Startop</hi> misliking of their reso<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lution, foreseeing the ouerstrength of the <hi>Dansker,</hi> or whether he was conquered with the Dutch-mans oath and promise, which was that hee would neither ransacke nor pillage any thing from him, hee refused to hoyst his sailes, and consented to the yéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>Which M. <hi>Humfrey</hi> and the rest perceiuing, &amp; not willing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to danger their owne ships, euery man shifted for themselues &amp; so escaped. Our ship, &amp; the Fleming were of the Lée-ward of the whole Fléet, so y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> when he was possessed of M. <hi>Startop,</hi> thē comes he vp to vs poore vanquished men, but it is a bootlesse mention to remember you, how easily it was for him to deale with vs, who had neyther powder nor other munition to offend him.</p>
            <p>The first word he spoke when he came vp to vs, was, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you to strike saile and follow me, and wee séeing it were a bootlesse resistance and that there was no remedy, obeyed him, onely we entreated him to be good vnto vs, and told him wee had beene robbed by the <hi>Tunis</hi> men of warre, Confederates with <hi>Ward,</hi> not sixe daies before. Captaine <hi>Dansker</hi> demaunded of Master <hi>Startop,</hi> whether the relation of our surprisal was true or no? who constantly in our behalfe affirmed it to be true, when he like a proude (yet we may call him an honest) Pirate toldvs, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> since y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> men of <hi>Tunis,</hi> had had vs in hand, he scorned to rob an hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall: to afflict where was misery before, or to make pray of them who had nothingleft. Only by a Messenger cōmanded vs, to shoot off 3 péeces of Ordinance as a thanks to him, or ransome for our libertie and depart: but we certifying him, that such was the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of our enemies, that we had not so much left whereby to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his curtesie, and answer his command, he forthwith gaue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der we should be dismist, but kept the Flemming and M. <hi>Startop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Flemming</hi> was laden with Corne, and vpon it, lay di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers trusses and bales of rich stuffes, to the valew of twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pound, the which stuffes hee tooke away from them, béeing the Marchants goods, but not any particuler aduenture that was due to any priuate man: so that this is the difference betwéene these two Pirats, <hi>(Ward</hi> of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and <hi>Dansker</hi> of <hi>Argier:) Ward</hi> makes prey of all, and <hi>Dansker</hi> hath compassion of some: the one contemning to be charitable to any, the other holding it
<pb facs="tcp:173113:15"/> hatefull to take any thing from them, who labour in continuall danger to maintaine their liues. And we haue heard that the like cause as this, was the falling out betwixt these two Pirates. for certaine they are now at difference.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Flemming</hi> (who before we haue spoken of) though at the first he commanded him with him, the next day hee dismissed him and sent him after vs: but M. <hi>Startop</hi> and his whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he caried away directly for <hi>Argier,</hi> where what will succéed vnto them is yet vncertaine.</p>
            <p>But I must bee bold to remember you, what in this discourse I haue omitted, that before he left vs, some of our confederates, men who vpon our first taking, were discharged out of their ship, into ours of the <hi>Charitie,</hi> séeing how vncertaine was their hope, and how continuall was their danger (since euery ship wee saw wee must feare to bee a Pirate) they entreated of the <hi>Dansker,</hi> that he would be pleased to set them a shoare: when hee not only condiscended to their request, but also gaue them foure shillings a peece, to helpe to carry them vp into the Country of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus to our sorrow: hauing seene our good friend Maister <hi>Startop,</hi> and his whole Companie hoysted toward <hi>Argier,</hi> our selues (consorted with the <hi>Duchman)</hi> put in at <hi>Almanika</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> where we intended to repaire vs, of what necessaries we lacked, that might furnish vs for our better safetie home-ward. The Gouernour of which (hauing at large vnderstood what had happened vnto vs) commaunded that we should haue all hings that we thought needfull for vs, and offered vs a hundred men for a safeguard euery night, while wee staid there to repaire our wants, least they should come backe, or any other of their Crue to doe vs iniury.</p>
            <p>But while we remained in this Harbor, repairing our ships and furnishing our wants, there was Newes brought to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour: the tenure whereof were spread thus: That the <hi>Cros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> who at the first was but a <hi>Ianizarie,</hi> and since aduanced by his confederacy with <hi>Ward,</hi> is now the prime Gouernor of <hi>Tunis</hi> That <hi>Ward</hi> hath a while retyred him from Sea, and sends forth his Colleagues, as he did the fléete, which surprised vs, not min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to put himselfe to hazard againe vpon the maine, till they can take a ship for him, shall be Owner of thréescore péeces of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
<pb facs="tcp:173113:16"/> in emulation that <hi>Danskers</hi> beares 55. That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer his confederates bring in to him, they transport it for saile to <hi>Sophe,</hi> and <hi>Sancta Cruce,</hi> 2. Port Townes, that lead vp to <hi>Morocco</hi> and <hi>Fesse,</hi> and that while he continues in <hi>Tunis,</hi> he is not idle, but practiseth the casting of ordinance, and in training vp those Turkes which he hath purchased leaue to leauy (as it is reported of the <hi>Grand Signior)</hi> in Military Discipline.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I truly deliuered vnto you what hath happened to vs at sea, by which you may iudge what difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our states and yours ashoare; I haue giuen the marchant cause to feare, and haue giuen him heart to strengthen himselfe for defence: which if he doe not do, &amp; not leaue til these Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates be deprest, they may hang vp their ships and bid farewell with their Traffick to the <hi>Straights.</hi>
